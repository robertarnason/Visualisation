# Visualisation
Final project for the module Visualisation - MSc Business Analytics

This was a final group project in the Business Analytics visualisation module, the module covered a lot of theoretical aspects of visualisation along with some programming in R. There were three visualisations needed for this final project and my contribution is Exhibit 1. It includes some interactive features where the data is filtered based on the dropdown selection. More information on the final submission can be seen in the PDF summary.
